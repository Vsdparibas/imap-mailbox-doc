# Installation

To install IMAP mailbox, you need to install the library :

```bash
npm install imap-mailbox
```

If you are working with ES modules, then use imports :

```js
import Imap from 'imap-mailbox';
```

If you are working with CommonJS, then use require :

```js
const Imap = require('imap-mailbox').default;
```

In the next part, we will see how to configure the mailbox.
